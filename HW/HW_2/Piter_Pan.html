<h1>Peter Pan</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    <b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie.</a>A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who
    can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a

    occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.

by Barrie, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird"><i>Little White Bird</i></a> (1902, with
chapters 13–18 published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens"><i>Peter Pan

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a>
(1904,
which expanded into the 1911 novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter and
    Wendy</i></a>), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding
on Barrie's
works. These include several films, television series and many other works.
<p>
    Barrie commissioned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_statue">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the
    sculptor
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frampton">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Six other statues have been cast from
    the
    original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a

    the character.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird"><i>The Little White Bird</i></a>
    (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters
    13–18, titled "Peter Pan in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a>, Peter
    is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
    Kensington Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
    "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of
    his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play">stage play</a> titled <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a>,
    which
    premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of
    York's Theatre</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Following the
    success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_and_Stoughton">Hodder
    and Stoughton</a>,
    extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens"><i>Peter Pan in
    Kensington Gardens</i></a>, with the addition of illustrations by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Barrie later adapted and expanded
    the
    1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
    J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating
    accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
</p>
<h2>Physical appearance</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    1907 illustration of Peter Pan by Oliver Herford
    Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader
    and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and
    cobwebs.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> His name and playing the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_flute">flute or pipes</a> suggest the Greek god and mythological
    character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)">Pan</a>. Barrie
    mentions in <i>Peter and Wendy</i> that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth".<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> He describes him as a
    "lovely boy,
    clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees".<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> In <i>The Little White
    Bird</i>
    (1902) and Peter Pan in
    Kensington Gardens (1906), he is seven days old. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    Traditionally, the character has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_boy">played on stage by a
    petite adult woman</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In the
    original productions in the
    UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Boucicault">Nina Boucicault</a> in 1904.
    This costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The similar costume worn by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Chase">Pauline Chase</a> (who played the role
    from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_London">Museum of London</a>.
    Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a
    red costume<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-12"><sup></sup></a> but a green costume (whether or
    not made of
    leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and
    more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.
</p>
<p>
    In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made
    of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf">>elf</a>-like
    ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.
</p>
<p>
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)"><i>Hook</i></a> (1991), the character is played as an adult
    by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams">Robin Williams</a>, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in
    flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as
    Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).
</p>
<p>
    In the live-action <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_(2003_film)">2003 <i>Peter Pan</i> film</a>, he
    is portrayed by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Sumpter">Jeremy Sumpter</a>, with blond hair, green eyes, bare feet
    and a costume made of leaves and vines.
</p>
<p>
    In the prequel to the main story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(2015_film)">2015 <i>Pan</i> film</a>,
    he is portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Miller">Levi Miller</a>, a young boy who was left as
    a baby
    by the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple
    clothes.
</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are
    questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter
    symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.</p>
<p>Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger.
    Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one
    shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure." In the play, the unseen and
    unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, "To
    live would be an awfully big adventure!", "but he can never quite get the hang of it".<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, it is explained that Peter must forget
    his own
    adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.</p>
<p>Peter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In <i>The Little White Bird</i>, he is able to fly because
    he is
    said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a
    combination of "lovely wonderful thoughts" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play <i>Peter Pan, The Boy
        Who
        Wouldn't Grow up</i>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> the
    author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical
    needs:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    ...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that
    they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him;
    so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. – <small>J. M.
    Barrie</small>
</p>
<p>Peter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although
    Neverland appears different to every child, the island "wakes up" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the
    chapter "The Mermaids' Lagoon" in the book <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that
    Peter
    cannot do. He is a skilled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsman">swordsman</a>, rivalling even Captain
    Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has
    remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock
    in the crocodile.</p>
<p>Peter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.</p>
<p>In <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs. Darling heard as a child, was that when
    children
    died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.</p>
<p>In the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage
    directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a "kiss" (thimble),
    but is prevented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell">Tinker Bell</a>. However, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caird_(director)">John Caird</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Nunn">Trevor Nunn's</a> introduction to
    the script for the 1997 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre">Royal
        National Theatre</a> production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for
    a
    production in 1927, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre">Jean Forbes-Robertson</a>
    took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more
    fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.</p>
<h2>Cultural allusions</h2>
<hr>
<p>The character's name comes from two sources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Llewelyn_Davies">Peter
    Llewelyn Davies</a>, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired
    the story, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)">Pan</a>, a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_flute">pipes</a> to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphs">nymphs</a> and is part human and part goat. This
    is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens"><i>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</i></a>)
    where Peter Pan plays pipes to the
    fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the
    effects of upbringing on human behaviour, and he experienced a significant revival of interest among English
    artists, poets and novelists during the Edwardian <sup>[<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult
    appreciation of moral responsibility. As a "betwixt-and-between", who can fly and speak the language of fairies and
    birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Ridley">Rosalind Ridley</a>, by comparing Peter's
    behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism">Darwinian</a>
    questions about the origins of human
    nature and behaviour. As "the boy who wouldn't grow up", Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_development">cognitive
        development</a> seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both
    charmingly
    childlike and childishly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsistic</a><a

<p class="only-margin-top">Peter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in <a

    believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter
    "Lock-Out Time" in <i>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</i> but is not mentioned again.</p>
<p class="family"><b>Friends</b></p>
<p><b>Maimie Mannering</b></p>
<p>While in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter
    proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her
    mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her
    mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember
    Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Darling">Wendy Darling</a>.<a

<p class="underline-p"><i>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Darling">Wendy Darling</a></i></p>
<p>It is hinted that Wendy may have romantic feelings for Peter, but unrequited because of his inability to love.</p>
<p>In the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is
    implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time, Peter visits the real world, and befriends
    children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his "mother", is the most significant of them; he also brings her
    brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darling_(Peter_Pan)">John</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Darling_(Peter_Pan)">Michael</a> to Neverland at her request. It
    is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his
    attention.</p>
<p>In the 1991 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(movie)"><i>Hook</i></a>, an older Wendy implies that
    she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter,
    saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the 2002 sequel to the <a

    Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to
    show feelings for each other. In the 2003 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_(2003_film)"><i>>Peter
        Pan</i></a>, the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away
    Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves
    Peter by giving him her hidden kiss which gives him the will to live, signifying she is his true love.</p>
<p class="family"><b>John Darling and Michael Darling</b></p>
<p>John is Wendy's younger brother. He is fascinated with piracy and imitates Captain Hook while playing at home with
    his siblings. He is also courageous and smart. Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is convinced that Peter Pan is
    a real person after hearing Wendy's vivid narratives about him. During nursery games, it is Michael who plays the
    role of Peter Pan. <i>Peter Pan In Scarlet</i> reveals that Michael died in World War I.</p>

    Barrie refers to her as "a princess in her own right", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the
    pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic
    feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious to other people's feelings. In the
    Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn

<p>Tinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and is often jealously protective of him. He nicknames
    her "Tink". She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. Tink's malicious actions are usually caused by her
    jealousy; these lead to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy, and eventually revealing Peter's hideout to Captain
    Hook, in the hope that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks
    her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter. Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter are
